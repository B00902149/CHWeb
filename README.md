## 📌 About

This is the marketing and early-access website for **Coaching Hub** — a cross-platform fitness app that unifies workout tracking, nutrition logging, health metrics, and community into a single experience.

The site is built as a lightweight static site (HTML, CSS, JS — no frameworks) and is designed to:
- Introduce the app and its core features
- Showcase real app screenshots
- Embed a live demo video
- Collect early tester signups via Formspree

## 📬 Waitlist Form Setup (Formspree)

The waitlist form uses [Formspree](https://formspree.io) to collect signups and email them to you.

1. Sign up at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Create a new form — you'll receive an endpoint like `https://formspree.io/f/xyzabc12`
3. Open `js/app.js` and replace line 3:

```js
const FORMSPREE_URL = 'https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID';
```

Free tier: **50 submissions/month**. All entries are also visible in your Formspree dashboard.
